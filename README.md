# DUCK game

Duck (DU-C/K) is my entry for the Game Off 2018 game jam. The theme for the Game Off 2018 game jam was 'Hybrid'. Duck is a minigame mix game, following the theme both in topic and gameplay. It's protagonist is a duck - a creature of land and water and air - competing in three types of feats.
